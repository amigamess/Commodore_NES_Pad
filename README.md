# Commodore_NES_Pad
A 3D NES like pad for Commodore Dual Buttons + Autofire!

![nesPAD](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdfcb489-d0ae-49f6-bf2f-f40ce70fc11a)

This is my personal rev of a NES like PAd for C64. 
Dual Buttons (button a button b) you can use on AMIGA and C64 (for dual buttons in C64, you need to use my personal adapter).

I make also an MSX adapter for use it into MSX (dual buttons).

This is my PCB, you can order via PCBWAY.
